/**
 * A React component that renders the sub-object management page for the application.
 *
 * @remarks The component uses the `getAllSubObject` function from the `subObject` module to retrieve the sub-object data from the server. The component renders a `SubObjectLayout` component with the `subObjects` array as its prop, and a `SubObjectCreate` component as its child. The `SubObjectCreate` component is responsible for rendering the form for creating a new sub-object. The `AdminLayout` component is used to provide a layout for the page.
 *
 * @param subObjects - An array of `GenericObject`s representing the sub-objects to display in the sub-object layout.
 *
 * @returns A React component that renders the sub-object management page for the application.
